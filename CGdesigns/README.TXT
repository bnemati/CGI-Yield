Reductions due to reflections, CCD QE are omitted. Coronagraph mask throughputs
are included.  Polarizer reduction is included as noted below.

I = mean speckle intensity at r, normalized to flux incident on primary
contrast = I(r) / PSF_peak(r)
core_thruput = fraction of light incident on primary that makes it into the FWHM region of a field PSF centered at r
PSF_peak = fration of light in peak pixel of field PSF centered at r normalized to flux indicent on primary
area = area of the FWHM region of the field PSF centered at r
occ_trans = occulter * lyot stop transmission at r

Pixel sizes (for I, PSF_peak):  hlc, piaacmc = 0.3 lam/D, spc = 0.2 lam/D

Reduction by 0.5 due to polarizer included in HLC polx and piaacmc I,
core_thruput, PSF_peak, and occ_trans values
